After doing analysis in R for quiet some time, I decided to take on Python in order to enjoy the 
flexiibity and convenience of being a bilingual data scientist. Here I analyse the productivity of garment workers by some descriptive statistics and ultimately building
a machine learning model. This is a simplied project and is among my first Python projects. 

The aim was to practice data wrangling and visualiation skills and not building state-of-the-art model
as this comes higher computational costs

In some time to come I will extend the model by serving it via RESTful API using FastAPI or BentoML
